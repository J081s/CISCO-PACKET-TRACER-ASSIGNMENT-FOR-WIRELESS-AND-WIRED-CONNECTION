# Hybrid Wireless and Wired LAN – Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer project file** (`WIRELESS LAN/WIRELESS NETWORK.pkt`) that demonstrates the design and implementation of a **hybrid Local Area Network (LAN)** consisting of both **wireless** and **wired connections**.  

The project illustrates how different end devices (PCs, laptops, and smartphones) can communicate seamlessly in a single LAN through an **Access Point** and a **Switch**.

## 📂 Project Files
- **`WIRELESS NETWORK.pkt`** → Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the network topology.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) – version **7.3 or later**  
- A computer running **Windows, Linux, or macOS**  
- Basic knowledge of **LAN, IP addressing, and Packet Tracer simulation**

## 📡 Network Topology

The project simulates a **hybrid LAN**:

### 🔹 Wireless Section
- **Access Point (AccessPoint0)** → Provides Wi-Fi coverage  
- **PC0** (PC-PT) → Connected wirelessly  
- **Laptop0** (Laptop-PT) → Connected wirelessly  
- **Smartphone2** (Smartphone-PT) → Connected wirelessly  

### 🔹 Wired Section
- **Switch0** → Central device for wired connections  
- **PC1** (PC-PT) → Connected via Ethernet  
- **Laptop2** (Laptop-PT) → Connected via Ethernet  
- **Laptop3** (Laptop-PT) → Connected via Ethernet

## 🌐 Device Interconnection

- The **Access Point** connects to the **Switch**, bridging the **wireless** and **wired** sections of the LAN.  
- All devices, regardless of connection type, belong to the same network and can communicate (e.g., via `ping`).  
- Demonstrates a **real-world office or campus LAN** setup where both Wi-Fi and Ethernet coexist.
